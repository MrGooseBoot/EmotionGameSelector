# EmotionGameSelector
This project will be coded in C++ using object oriented programming to ask the user a range of questions and narrow down a choice for the user to accept/deny based on their mood.





Below is the basic concept of what I plan on making, whoever stumbles across this project is free to support, but I would like to put some code out there before someone codes this, but if you do just keep it to yourself for the time being, Thanks!





What it needs to do:


1. Take a list of my steam games (Downloaded ones only) and ask me a series of questions that narrow down my choices on what I should play based on my current mood.


2. When final selection of a game is made by the computer, then the program should ask if I’m happy with my choice. If I reply with some form of, “no”, then the program should rerun asking the same questions, but with the exception of that specific game no longer being an option of the repository. 


3. If I reply, “no” to 3 of the computers choices, (when rerun 3 times), then the program will tell me that I’m an idiot and don’t know what I want.


*4. (This is optional) take an practically unlimited number of games I want, but do not own, and ask me even more questions on my mood at that moment, as well as questions that aren’t correlated with my mood, such as how much money I have, what the reviews are saying (This question will be tricky), average number of hours players obtain, how difficult is it said to be?
